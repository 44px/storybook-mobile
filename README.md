## Quick Start

### Install

`yarn add -D storybook-mobile` or `npm install --dev storybook-mobile`

### Add `storybook-mobile` to your list of addons:

in `main.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  stories: ['./testStories/stories/*.js'],
  addons: ['@storybook/addon-viewport/register', 'storybook-mobile'],
}
```

This addon works best along with the [@storybook/addon-viewport](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/next/addons/viewport) addon, so please consider installing that as well if you don't have it already.
