## Quick Start

`yarn add -D storybook-mobile` or `npm install --dev storybook-mobile`

Next, add `storybook-mobile` to your list of addons:

`.storybook/main.js`

```js
module.exports = {
  // other config goes here
  addons: [
     '@storybook/addon-viewport/register',
+    'storybook-mobile'
     ],
}
```

This addon works best along with the [@storybook/addon-viewport](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/next/addons/viewport) addon, so please consider installing that as well if you don't have it already.
